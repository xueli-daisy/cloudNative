<p>It’s a great time to learn so many cloudnative knowledge, the teachers Mr. Meng and Mr. Pan, they have extensive experience and are good at teaching. The administrator Ms. LeLe, who reminds me to attend the classes and answer my course related questions, is very kind and responsible. </p>
<p>I am a Ph.D. student whose research direction is serverless computing. The functions’ containers are running on the servers or VMs, and Kubernetes is used as an orchestration tool to manage the containers.  By stepping into the second project of my research, I realize it is necessary to learn kubernetes systematically.  And by learning the knowledge step by step, I realize how narrow and limited my knowledge is.</p>
<p>I just finished some parts of the homeworks and haven’t finished all the modules' experiments. Hope someday I can finish them. It will be a great opportunity to gain some experience in cloud native fields.</p>
